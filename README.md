# yolov5_blood_cell_detection
This notebook shows training on the Blood Cell Dataset (BCCD). This technologoy will become easily accessible to any developer wishing to use computer vision in their projects.
To train our detector we take the following steps:<br>

Install YOLOv5 dependencies<br>

  Download custom YOLOv5 object detection data<br>
  Write our YOLOv5 Training configuration<br>
  Run YOLOv5 training<br>
  Evaluate YOLOv5 performance<br>
  Visualize YOLOv5 training data<br>
  Run YOLOv5 inference on test images<br>
  Export saved YOLOv5 weights for future inference
